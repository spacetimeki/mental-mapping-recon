# Conceptual Recon Lab – Nmap & Amass

This lab showcases **conceptual practice of network reconnaissance** using Nmap and Amass.  

> ⚠️ Disclaimer: This lab is conceptual. All exercises should be performed only in authorized environments. Do not attempt unauthorized scanning.

---

## Nmap Commands

- **Scan top 1000 TCP ports**  
```bash
nmap -sC -sV example.com

Purpose: Identify common open ports and running services.

    Full port scan

nmap -p 1-65535 -T4 example.com

Purpose: Discover all potential entry points across all ports.

    Aggressive scan (OS detection, scripts, version)

nmap -A example.com

Purpose: Gather detailed information about the host, including OS and services.

    Scan specific service port (HTTP example)

nmap -p 80 example.com

Purpose: Focused scanning for a particular service.

## Amass Commands

    Subdomain enumeration

amass enum -d example.com

Purpose: Identify all associated subdomains.

    Visualizing relationships

amass viz -d example.com -o viz.png

Purpose: Map relationships between domains and subdomains.

    Passive recon only

amass enum -passive -d example.com

Purpose: Gather information without actively probing the target.
Lab Notes – Conceptual Approach
Visualizing the Network

    Networks imagined as streets connecting multiple houses (domains).

    Ports represented as doors; open doors indicate potential entry points.

    Subdomains are side streets or smaller houses attached to main roads.

## Insights

    Recon provides the map for all further penetration testing phases.

    Mental visualization improves decision-making when interpreting outputs.

    Observing patterns in open ports and services helps prioritize high-value targets.

## Key Takeaways

    - Document each step thoroughly.

    Understand the context of scan results.

    Cross-reference Nmap and Amass outputs for comprehensive mapping.

    Recon is continuous, iterative, and analytical.

## Next Steps (Conceptual)

    CVE research and exploitation in lab environments.

    Advanced recon automation and scripting.

    Storytelling practice: mentally visualize netwo
